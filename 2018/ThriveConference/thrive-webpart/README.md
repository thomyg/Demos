## Thrive Conference Demo Web Part

Simple SPFx web part to showcase the Microsoft Teams capabilities within SPFx. It uses the current context to get information if the web part is surfaced in Teams or in SharePoint. Depending of the location a different text and image is shown. 

Web part was created by following this post <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/using-web-part-as-ms-teams-tab> 

Only difference is the use of the PnP yoeman generator instead of the SharePoint default one. Used SPFx version is 1.7.0 --plusbeta
